Due to the mobile revolution, people tend to use their smartphone while driving there car,
browsing the web, sending text message, making calls and more.
This puts the driver's safety at risk.
In this project I will try to solve this problem using Human machine interface system with the multimodality concept. 
This paper discuss of potential solution to this problem and describe the theory and the practical parts of this solution.
The system, provides a solution to the driver.
We can drive safer and at the same time use the multimodality approach in the vehicle system by combining input and output 
modes in various ways to help the driver get more information with a better user experience.

I tried to enable the driver to use the system functions and still be concentrated on driving.
To do that I enabled a speech interface that is used to activate any function 
of the application such as: weather report, SMS delivery, phone calls etc. 
In addition regardless of the function displayed, the driver can use speech to navigate across the application.
ASR engine is used as voice recognizer while the driver can say some designated key words 
that will activate the system functions.
A TTS (Text To Speech) engine will be used to provide output and give the driver information 
so the driver don’t even need look on the system monitor.
The system is designed as an Android application that runs on the user smartphone
for example the app take a music file from the smartphone memory and save notes in the smartphone memory.
System functionality include  making calls, send text messages, listen to music and more, the system 
bring the driver any information and function he need in simple way that won't interrupt him, 
to encourage the driver to maintain the primary task, which is to drive the car in a safe manner.
The uniqueness of this system over other vehicle system that this system work by the multimodality concept.
Almost every vehicle system has human machine interface but this system bring something more, 
the multimodality concept bring the options of using the system by combining different modes.
